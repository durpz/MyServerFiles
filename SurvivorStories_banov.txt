I first heard the rumors on the radio: a surgical virus had escaped from the old research complex near Dvorec. They said it was supposed to be "harmless," but then people started acting… odd. Soldiers in blue-trimmed uniforms (Helix) and green-trimmed armor (Aegis) arrived within hours.

March 7  
Helix troops set up a checkpoint south of Biskupice with massive floodlights. North in Velk DrzKovce, Aegis armored vehicles rolled in, spraying loudspeaker warnings. Both sides wear black masks, but Helix patches glow electric blue, Aegis ones shimmer dark green. I slipped through the gap between their patrols under cover of midnight fog.

The first paratroopers hit the outskirts of Sliezska Osada. Engines thundered overhead, then green flares blossomed in the sky. Black-masked figures drifted down like ghosts, their rifles ring-stamped “Aegis.” They sealed every street corner—no one got past without papers stamped by their officers.

At the river near Latkovce, a band of cultists calls itself “Children of Kuru.” They wear blood-red robes and carve arcane symbols on walls, claiming the virus is a divine test. Locals whisper that drinking from the river at night brings visions—and sometimes you never wake up.

Food is running out. Aegis convoys steal from abandoned shops, Helix drones scan markets for black-market sellers. Rumor: if you pledge allegiance to one faction, you get safe rations—blue-armband for Helix, green-armband for Aegis—but you’re bound to their curfew.

I hid in Miezgovce as a cultist preacher climbed atop a burned-out car. He shouted that “Kuru’s Blessing” will purge the weak. In a heartbeat, Helix paratroopers opened fire. I dove behind a barricade—shells kicked up shards of concrete.

My dog, Max, is sick. Patches of fur fallen, eyes burning red. I’m writing this in case I don’t make it back. If anyone finds these words—beware the flares in the sky, trust no soldier, and never follow a cultist into the darkness.

March 22  
Tonight I’m headed north from Latkovce to the abandoned labs east of Dvorec. If I can get inside, I might find a cure—or at least answers. But with Helix drones overhead and Aegis patrols everywhere, I doubt I’ll make it back. Whoever reads this: choose your side wisely.
